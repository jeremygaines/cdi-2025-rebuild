Since we updated data for this edition of the CDI, Argentina has also signed the WTO Agreement on Fisheries Subsidies. Argentina’s greenhouse gas emissions are below average (7.8 tonnes CO<sub>2</sub> equivalent per capita, compared to a CDI average of 10.2 tonnes) though its Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) is not very ambitious—by 2030 Argentina plans to reduce its emissions by 12 percent relative to expected emissions based on GDP growth (the CDI median is a reduction of 34 percent).</p><p>Argentina has significantly reduced its subsidy support to fossil fuel production and consumption in the last few years, and consequently ranks 20th, up from 36th in the previous CDI, though fossil fuel production has remained steady relative to the size of its population.

However, its performance is middling across the other components. Its lowest ranks are on the investment and security components (26th in each) due to the lack of development policy space it provides in its international investment agreements with lower-income countries and its lack of corporate tax rate alignment in the former and relatively high volume of arms exports in the latter.</p><p>When we assess Belgium relative to expectations based on its income level, its rank drops to 15th. Full income-adjusted results are at the end of the country report.</p>",
    "components": {
      "development-finance": "<p>Belgium ranks 5th on development finance. It scores well on development finance quantity, providing 0.40 percent of GNI in <a href=\"https://www.cgdev.org/sites/default/files/Finance-international-development-update.pdf\">Finance for International Development</a>—above the CDI average of 0.28 percent—but its high rank is driven primarily by the quality of that finance, for which it ranks 3rd.</p><p>Belgium’s development finance had the highest “poverty focus” of all CDI countries, meaning it targets countries that are poorer on average than any other CDI country. Belgium was among the countries most transparent about its development finance activities (along with other members of the Development Assistance Committee), and nearly all of Belgium’s aid contracts are open to bidders from other countries, making its finance largely untied. Belgium has most room for improvement on country ownership, the only measure on which it is in the bottom half, ranking 28th. It should ensure it provides finance in line with the priorities of its partner countries.</p>",
      "investment": "<p>Belgium ranks 26th on the investment component. Its worst score is on the corporate tax rate alignment indicator, for which it ranks 34th. Belgium is currently <a href=\"https://www.loyensloeff.com/insights/news--events/news/first-phase-of-belgian-tax-reform-submitted-to-parliament/\">reforming</a> its tax system, but as of 2022, its lowest available corporate tax rate was just 3 percent—significantly lower than the globally agreed 15 percent minimum.</p><p>However, Belgium is among the best performers on financial secrecy, ranking 3rd, with strict requirements on banking transparency and for companies to report country-by-country activities. It participates in the Kimberley Process to eliminate conflict diamonds and supports transparency in the extractives industry.</p><p>However, Belgium has limited to no enforcement of the OECD Anti-Bribery Convention, and scores below the CDI average on the degree of policy space to pursue development objectives in its bilateral international investment agreements with lower-income country counterparts.</p><p>To improve its performance, Belgium should raise its corporate income tax rates, ensure that future investment treaties leave space for partner countries to pursue development objectives, and make greater efforts to ensure bribery is not tolerated.</p>",
      "migration": "<p>Belgium ranks 4th on migration, up from 7th in the 2023 CDI, and ranking in the top half for all migration indicators. It has some of the best policies for helping migrants to integrate (ranking 7th), has fully ratified the International Labour Organization (ILO) Migration for Employment Convention, and has completed a voluntary review of its implementation of the UN Global Compact for Migration. It should, however, ensure migrants’ rights are protected by ratifying the ILO Migrant Workers Convention.</p><p>Belgium has significantly increased the number of migrants it accepts relative to its population, from under 9 per 1,000 people two years ago to 16 per 1,000 people now. These migrants tend to come from countries with lower incomes than for the typical CDI country, meaning Belgium ranks 5th on the inward migration indicator. Belgium hosts slightly more refugees than the majority of CDI countries, at almost 15 refugees per 1,000 population, compared to a CDI average of 11.</p>",
      "trade": "<p>Belgium ranks 11th on trade. Along with other EU members, it ranks joint 4th and joint 7th on the tariffs and tariff peaks (tariff lines with rates of 15 percent or more) indicators, respectively, with EU tariffs generally low and including several exemptions for poorer countries. However, Belgium has scope to reduce the restrictiveness of its trade in services, where it comes in the bottom half of CDI countries (particularly in the accounting and air transport sectors).</p><p>Belgium also provides significant agricultural subsidies mostly agreed at the EU level (worth 13.3 percent of farm gate production value, compared to a CDI average of 12.6 percent), putting agricultural exporters from lower-income countries at a disadvantage.</p>",
      "environment": "<p>Belgium places 23rd on the environment component. Belgium is one of only five CDI countries to have ratified all environmental treaties included in the CDI, and it is up to date on existing reporting commitments to, for example, the Convention on Biological Diversity. It also performs well in fossil fuel production: Belgium does not produce any coal and negligible amounts of natural gas, but it does produce small amounts of oil.</p><p>However, Belgium’s score is hampered by significant greenhouse gas emissions per capita: its direct domestic emissions have fallen to 8.3 tonnes CO<sub>2</sub> equivalent per person compared to a CDI country average of 9.1, but it has significant emissions embodied in its international trade—the second-most of any CDI country. Its environmental performance is further held back by the subsidies it provides for oil and gas, both above the CDI averages.</p>",
      "health": "<p>Belgium ranks 9th on the health component. It ranks in the top 10 on international tobacco supply chains, having signed, ratified, and reported on its implementation of key treaties regulating the tobacco trade. It also performs well on antimicrobial resistance (AMR) governance, ranking in the top five; its national AMR action plan identifies funding and is being implemented, and it scores well on AMR within its Joint External Evaluation with the World Health Organization. It has also signed up to the global antimicrobial resistance and use surveillance system, reflecting its broader participation in health codes and treaties, for which it ranks joint 5th.</p><p>Belgium should push for the EU to lift its export restrictions on food and health products, which are among the highest in the CDI. Although relatively few lines are covered by these restrictions, they have remained in place over much of the last two years.</p>",
      "security": "<p>Belgium ranks 26th on the security component. It has ratified all international security treaties for which the CDI gives credit, ranking joint 1st on that indicator.</p><p>Belgium’s financial and troop contributions to peacekeeping are worth roughly 0.012 percent of its GNI, below the CDI average of 0.019 percent (making Belgium 23rd on peacekeeping), and the proportion of peacekeepers it does deploy who are women is low at 5 percent. However, it makes additional contributions to sea lanes protection, with the value of deployed vessels worth 0.016 percent of GNI.</p><p>Belgium has significant room for improvement on the arms trade indicator. Although the destinations of Belgian arms exports are not as fragile or conflict-prone as those of most other CDI countries, the volume of <a id=\"_Hlk79500835\"></a>Belgium’s arms exports—0.39 percent of its GNI—is double the CDI median of 0.18 percent of GNI.</p>",
      "technology": "<p>Belgium ranks 15th on the technology component. Belgium’s government provides direct support for research and development (R&amp;D) worth 0.58 percent of its GNI, which is slightly above the CDI average. However, it comes in the top 10 countries on providing tax incentives for private business R&amp;D, with implied subsidies worth 0.35 percent of GNI, almost double the CDI average.</p><p>On indicators measuring technology transfer and diffusion policies, Belgium displays mixed performance. It ranks in the higher end for the proportion of foreign students it admits from poorer countries. At 59 percent, the proportion of its foreign student population that is female is second highest of all CDI countries. However, its research collaborations are slightly less likely to be with lower-income-country researchers than the CDI average, and, along with other EU countries, its trade agreements with lower-income countries are restrictive beyond World Trade Organization standards when it comes to intellectual property rights, hindering the spread of useful knowledge.</p>"

It provides 58 percent of its finance through multilateral agencies, higher than the average but a significant reduction from 95 percent in the 2023 CDI.</p>",
      "investment": "<p>Brazil ranks 10th on investment—by far the best performance of the BRICS+. It jumps to 3rd when we adjust Brazil's score for income.</p><p>Brazil’s corporate income tax rate is higher than both the globally agreed effective minimum of 15 percent and the developing country average rate of 25 percent, meaning it is unlikely to be used to facilitate tax avoidance by large multinational enterprises. Brazil also tops the indicator on international investment agreements; its bilateral investment agreements also leave a significant degree of policy space for its partner countries to pursue their own development objectives.</p><p>There are, however, a number of ways that Brazil could further improve its investment policy to capitalise on its good performance. It ranks 35th on financial secrecy and should focus on reducing the secrecy of its banking regulations and on strengthening its anti-money laundering policies. Although it participates in the Kimberley Process, it should also become a member of the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative to improve its natural resources governance. Brazil could also improve its enforcement of the OECD Anti-Bribery Convention, which is currently assessed as “limited” by Transparency International.</p>",
      "migration": "<p>Brazil ranks 30th on the migration component, rising to 18th when its score is adjusted for income. It ranks in the bottom 10 countries for the number of migrants it accepts (when weighted by the income of their origin countries)<a id=\"_Hlk79501461\"></a>, and the proportion that are female is 46 percent, just below the CDI average of 48 percent. Since the last CDI, it has significantly increased the number of refugees it hosts, although it remains below average with just over 1 refugee per 1,000 people in the most recent data year, compared to the CDI average of 11.</p><p>Brazil has good domestic policies to help migrants integrate into society and the economy, ranking joint 10th. It could improve its support for migrants by signing the International Labour Organization’s Convention on Migrant Workers and completing a voluntary review of its implementation of the Global Compact for Migration.</p>",
      "trade": "<p>Brazil ranks 36th on trade, making this its joint weakest component in the CDI. It has significant room to improve on its tariffs against poorer countries: it has high average tariff rates with fewer exemptions for less developed trade partners than the CDI average, and a high number of tariff peaks (product lines with tariffs of 15 percent or higher). Its trade logistics are relatively poor, both for its customs regime and its trade infrastructure as assessed by the World Bank, and its trade in services is also highly restricted as assessed by the OECD.</p><p>Positively, Brazil ranks in the top five countries on avoiding agricultural subsidies. It gives only 2.0 percent of farm gate production value in trade-distorting agricultural subsidies, compared to a CDI average of 12.6 percent.</p>",
      "environment": "<p>Brazil ranks 28th in the environment component.</p><p>Brazil ranks 13th for its greenhouse gas emissions: its direct emissions from energy, waste, agriculture, and industry were 5.7 tonnes of CO<sub>2</sub> equivalent per person compared to the CDI average of 9.1. It also has the second-highest emissions per capita (1.9 tonnes of CO<sub>2</sub> equivalent) from land use change and forestry, and ranks 26th for its production of fossil fuels per capita.</p><p>Brazil is one of only nine CDI countries with no carbon pricing scheme, meaning it ranks joint last for this indicator. It has signed all the biodiversity and environment agreements considered in the CDI, although its acceptance of the World Trade Organization Agreement on Fishing Subsidies was after the CDI data was updated.</p>",
      "health": "<p>Brazil ranks 28th in the health component. It has among the weakest vaccination coverage in the CDI, with coverage for the measles and the diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis vaccinations standing at 64 percent and 90 percent respectively—a significant improvement on two years ago, but still not back to pre-COVID levels and World Health Organization targets. Brazil also imposed significant export restrictions on medical product lines in the past two years and comes in the bottom 10 on this indicator.</p><p>Brazil ranks 28th on antimicrobial resistance (AMR): consumption of antibiotics in humans and livestock in Brazil is approximately equal to the CDI average, and Brazil could improve its AMR governance by completing a Joint External Evaluation (JEE) with the World Health Organization and updating its national action plan on AMR. Completing a JEE would also contribute to improving its pandemic preparedness, and signing up to the Global Antimicrobial Resistance and Use Surveillance System module on antimicrobial consumption (GLASS-AMC) would mean it ranked top on the health treaties indicator—and would likely lead to better performance on AMR.</p>",
      "security": "<p>Brazil ranks 25th in the security component. Its peacekeeping contributions were worth an equivalent of 0.002 percent of its GNI, less than one-tenth of the CDI average. That said, of the peacekeepers it sent on UN missions, 17 percent were female; this represents continued significant progress and means Brazil now ranks 10th on the indicator, up from 29th since the 2023 edition of the CDI.</p><p>Brazil ranks in the top five for its arms trade with a low volume (worth 0.06 percent of GNI compared to a median of 0.18 percent), and it appears that these exports were less likely to go to conflict-prone countries (poorer, more militaristic, and less democratic) than were other countries’ exports. However, it should publish data on destinations of its arms exports and improve its commitment to global security by signing the Convention on Cluster Munitions.</p>",
      "technology": "<p>Brazil ranks 20th in the technology component.</p><p>Brazil’s government allocates 0.63 percent of GNI directly to research and development (R&amp;D), and a further 0.07 percent in tax incentives for private business R&amp;D.</p><p>Brazil does less well for the number of foreign students it accepts—among CDI countries, Brazil has the third-lowest share of foreign students in its total student population, though they were more likely to come from lower-income countries. Of the students it accepts, 46 percent are female, compared to a CDI average of 49 percent. Brazil ranks in the higher end of the table on intellectual property rights: its free trade agreements with lower-income countries contain fewer additional intellectual property rights restrictions beyond existing World Trade Organization standards than the CDI average.</p>"

The quality of that finance is ranked 20th: Canada reports regularly and transparently on its bilateral finance, its projects are open to bids from contractors from other countries, and it is relatively well targeted at poor and fragile countries. However, Canada spends a relatively small proportion (26 percent) of its aid through multilateral channels.</p>",
      "investment": "<p>Canada ranks 3rd on investment, making this its strongest area. Its strongest performance is on its bilateral investment agreements, where it ranks 2nd, indicating that these include few clauses to protect its investors at the expense of the host country’s policy space to pursue development objectives. Other areas of strength include Canada’s commitment to natural resource governance investment standards, and its corporate income tax rate, which exceeds the average of lower- and middle-income countries (25 percent) and the globally agreed effective minimum of 15 percent, meaning it is less likely to be used to facilitate corporate tax avoidance by large multinational enterprises than most CDI countries.</p><p>Still, Canada has room for improvement on business and human rights and should adopt a National Action Plan on the subject. Transparency International has assessed Canada as having “limited” enforcement of the OECD Anti-Bribery Convention. Canada should also do more to limit its financial secrecy, especially its beneficial ownership regulations and agreements on automatic exchange of information with other jurisdictions.</p>",
      "migration": "<p>Canada ranks 8th on the migration component: it has significantly increased the number of migrants it accepts in recent years, from under five per 1,000 people to over 10 in the latest figures. That said, Canada has <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cd7n3rqyjqzo\">announced</a> a sharp reduction in its targets for new permanent residents. Its immigrants also tend to be from lower-income countries, meaning that it now ranks 7th on the inward migration indicator.

      "trade": "<p>Canada ranks 12th in the trade component, maintaining its improvement on its 2021 CDI performance that saw improvements in trade logistics. It has the 2nd best trade logistics of all CDI countries, as well as relative strengths in limiting agricultural subsidies, which fell slightly in recent years (to 5.2 percent of farm gate production value, compared to a CDI average of 12.6 percent). It performs above most countries on limiting restrictions on trade in services (ranking 17th on this indicator).</p><p>Canada’s performance is held back by its relatively high average tariff rates (when inversely weighted by trading partner income), for which it ranks 27th, and by the number of tariff peaks it imposes (product lines with tariffs of 15 percent or higher), which, although somewhat improved, still mean it ranks 29th of all CDI countries; it should reduce these to enable trade with lower-income countries.</p>",
      "environment": "<p>Canada ranks 34th in the environment component, with ample room for improvement on reducing its greenhouse gas emissions, fossil fuel production, and fishing subsidies.</p><p>Although emissions embodied in Canada’s international trade are negative, it produced almost double the CDI average in direct emissions from energy, waste, agriculture, and industry at 17.5 tonnes of CO<sub>2</sub> equivalent per capita (compared to a CDI average of 9.1). Canada’s Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) shows a high degree of ambition on climate, suggesting it plans to reduce emissions by 45 percent below what it is expected to emit in 2030, or almost 40 percent lower than its current emissions, ranking as the second most ambitious country. Still, it is unclear if Canada can meet this target given current policies. The CO<sub>2</sub> per capita embodied in its fossil fuel production is over three times higher than the CDI average, and it ranks mid-table on carbon pricing, with the average tonne of CO<sub>2</sub> emissions priced at an additional $13.85, slightly below the CDI average of $15.23.</p><p>Canada provides harmful subsidies to the fishing industry equivalent to over 9 percent of the production value, higher than most CDI countries for which we have comprehensive data. To improve, it should reduce these subsidies and build on the progress of rejoining the International Tropical Timber Organisation in 2023 by ratifying the Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals.</p>",
      "health": "<p>Canada ranks 13th in the health component. It does well on pandemic preparedness, ranking joint 1st, but has a middling performance on most other indicators.</p><p>Canada has made a number of improvements in antimicrobial resistance since the last edition of the CDI. It has become a member of the antimicrobial consumption module of the Global Antimicrobial Resistance and Use Surveillance System (GLASS-AMC), meaning it now ranks joint 21st for its participation in health treaties. Canada has published data on antimicrobial consumption rates showing an improvement, and it has published a new National Action Plan on AMR.</p><p>Canada ranks in the bottom 10 for its vaccination coverage: an immunization rate of 79 percent for measles is much lower than the CDI median of 92 percent.</p>",
      "security": "<p>Canada ranks 16th in the security component. Its contributions of troops and finance to peacekeeping missions, worth 0.011 percent of its GNI, are below the CDI average of 0.019 percent—although the troops it sends on UN peacekeeping missions include the second-highest proportion of women, at almost 30 percent. Canada has also ratified all the security treaties assessed in the CDI, meaning it ranks joint 1st on the security treaties indicator.</p><p>Canada’s arms exports as a share of GNI are below the CDI average. However, it can improve its performance on arms trade by exporting to less conflict-prone countries.</p>",
      "technology": "<p>Canada ranks 4th overall in the technology component and is also the top-scoring G7 economy in this policy area.</p><p>Although it has a middling performance for its policies on knowledge production, with direct government support for research and development (R&amp;D) worth 0.53 percent of GNI, and tax incentives for private business R&amp;D worth a further 0.2 percent—each lower than average—it performs better than most on its technology diffusion and transfer policies.</p><p>Canada performs well on the number of foreign students it accepts (when weighted inversely by the income of their origin countries), ranking 4th.

On the climate ambition indicator, its Nationally Determined Contribution suggests that it plans to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 by 41 percent compared with a business-as-usual scenario.

Its direct financial contributions to UN peacekeeping and the value of troops sent to non-UN missions are both higher than average, but the monetary equivalent value of troops sent to UN missions is below average (and, of the troops sent on UN peacekeeping missions, a low share of 11 percent were female). To improve on this component, Switzerland should increase the number of troops it sends to UN peacekeeping missions and increase the percentage of women peacekeepers.</p>",
      "technology": "<p>Switzerland ranks 7th in the technology component, a gain of 11 ranks compared to the 2023 edition of the CDI, making this its strongest component.</p><p>Switzerland ranks in the top five on government budget support for research and development (R&amp;D), worth 0.90 percent of GNI compared to a CDI average of 0.55 percent. However, despite its reputation for innovation, Switzerland was much less generous with its tax incentives for private business R&amp;D, instead effectively imposing additional taxes worth 0.02 percent of GNI and ranking last on the indicator.</p><p>Switzerland has a middling performance on its policies for knowledge diffusion. It ranks 15th for the number of foreign students it hosts: they account for almost 20 percent of Switzerland’s total tertiary student population, which is the sixth highest in the CDI, but those students were also among the least likely to come from lower-income countries.

    "components": {
      "development-finance": "<p>The UK ranks 9th in the development finance component, coming 11th for quantity (based on 2024 data, before announced aid reductions) and 4th for quality. The UK provided 0.37 percent of its GNI as development finance compared to a CDI average of 0.28 percent. These values are based on CGD’s <a href=\"https://www.cgdev.org/sites/default/files/Finance-international-development-update.pdf\">Finance for International Development</a> measure, conceptually lower than official development assistance as it excludes flows spent domestically.</p><p>The UK’s development finance is transparently reported, and its allocation has a strong focus on fragile states relative to other providers. It performs well on the poverty focus of its allocation, too. The share of the UK’s development projects aligned with recipient country priorities (79 percent) has improved in more recent survey data and is now above the CDI average (65 percent). However, the UK provides a below-average share of its aid through multilateral organisations (27 percent versus the CDI average of 47 percent).</p>",
      "investment": "<p>The UK ranks 5th on the investment component. It ranks joint first for business and human rights (fully engaging with the OECD’s responsible business conduct principles), as well as for its natural resource governance (it participates in the Kimberly Process and supports and meaningfully implements the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative standard). The UK also ranks joint 3rd for its enforcement of the OECD Anti-Bribery Convention.</p><p>The UK also performs relatively well on tackling financial secrecy (rank 10), though its overseas territories weigh down on its rank. The UK still lags behind average performance in banking secrecy and on making statistics on its economic and financial engagement with the wider world publicly available.</p><p>The UK has most room for improvement on international investment agreements (rank 28), and on the new corporate tax rate alignment indicator (rank 29), which is brought down by the network of Crown Dependencies and Overseas Territories that are used as tax havens or offshore financial centres. To improve, the UK should include fewer provisions in its bilateral investment agreements that limit the policy space of its counterparts to pursue their development objectives. It could also improve in this area by ensuring that it and its dependent jurisdictions are in line with the globally agreed minimum effective corporate tax rate of 15 percent.</p>",
      "migration": "<p>The UK ranks 22nd in the migration component.</p><p>Despite the influx of refugees arriving by small boat in recent years, the UK ranks mid-table (20th) for the number of refugees it hosts (7.1 per 1,000 people, compared to a CDI average of 11). It is in the bottom half of countries in terms of the number of non-refugee migrants it accepts relative to its population, both in terms of the numbers relative to population and the extent to which they come from lower-income countries. Still, the share of these migrants who are female is 52 percent, which is above the CDI average of 48 percent.</p><p>The UK ranks joint 18th in the most recent assessment of its policies aiming to help migrants integrate through education, employment, and health. It ranks 9th for its ratification of international conventions aiming to protect migrants: it has not ratified the Migrant Workers Convention and has ratified the Migration for Employment Convention with only limited provisions.</p>",
      "trade": "<p>The UK ranks 4th in the trade component, a rise of four  places since the 2023 CDI. It ranks 3rd for its average tariff rates (weighted inversely to the income of the trading partner), and 6th for its below-average number of tariff peaks (tariff lines with rates of 15 percent or higher). The latest data (2023) is beginning to reflect the implementation of the UK’s new Developing Countries Trading Scheme, which lowered tariffs from the middle of that year. The UK also has relatively few restrictions on trade in services across sectors, where it ranks 2nd. It ranks 19th on the trade logistics indicator, which measures the quality of customs procedures and trade infrastructure.</p><p>The UK has most room to improve on agricultural subsidies, though these have fallen since the last edition of the CDI. Currently, they are worth 9.5 percent of farm gate production value and have fallen below the CDI average of 12.6 percent.</p>",
      "environment": "<p>The UK ranks 10th in the environment component. </p><p>It has signed up to all the biodiversity and environmental agreements assessed in the CDI and has accepted the World Trade Organization Agreement on Fisheries Subsidies since the last edition. Its reporting is up to date on all but one, so ranks joint 6th on this indicator. It ranks 20th on harmful subsidies to the fishing industry, with subsidies of 2.4 percent of production value against a CDI average of 9.9 percent. </p><p>The UK’s rank on carbon pricing has fallen from 10th to 15th, adding $16.01 to the cost of emitting one tonne of CO<sub>2</sub>, just above the CDI average of $15.23 but down on its previous figure of $21.09. Its rank is also middling—18th—for its direct and indirect greenhouse gas emissions, which stand at 8.3 tonnes of CO<sub>2</sub> equivalent per capita when accounting for both land use change and emissions embodied in trade (though this is still lower than the CDI average of 10.2 tonnes). The UK scores better on the ambition of its Nationally Determined Contribution: by 2030 it plans to reduce its emissions by 41 percent against current business-as-usual projections (above the CDI average of 31 percent).</p><p>The UK could improve by reducing its production of fossil fuels, as well as its financial support to the domestic consumption and production of fossil fuels. The UK ranks 23rd for the amount of CO<sub>2</sub> per capita embodied in the fossil fuels it produces, mainly via oil and gas. This production amounts to 2.9 tonnes of CO<sub>2</sub> equivalent per capita (compared to a CDI median of 1.6).

It fulfils all of our indicators on the regulation of tobacco supply chains, and participates in all of the health treaties, codes, and memberships we assess.</p><p>The UK performs above most countries (ranking 11th) for its policies on antimicrobial resistance, with above-average governance and relatively low antibiotic use among animals. Still, antibiotic use in humans is slightly above the CDI average (19.2 defined daily doses per 1,000 people). It also ranks joint 14th on pandemic preparedness.</p><p>The UK ranks in the bottom half of countries on vaccination coverage: its immunization coverage by the nationally recommended age is 85 percent for measles (against a CDI median of 92 percent), and its immunization coverage among 1-year-olds is 92 percent for diphtheria, tetanus toxoid, and pertussis (against a CDI median of 95 percent). It also ranks 29th for its export restrictions on food and health products (even after removing sanctions against Russia), with a relatively large number of product lines covered by restrictions.</p>",
      "security": "<p>The UK ranks 8th in the security component. It scores strongly across several elements, including ranking 3rd on its allocation of naval resources to protect international sea lanes (worth around 0.083 percent of its GNI, compared to a CDI average of 0.019 percent). It has ratified all nine security conventions that are credited in the CDI, and since the 2023 CDI it has reconsented to Protocol V on the Explosive Remnants of War as part of the Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons. It ranks 14th for its troop and financial contributions to global peacekeeping missions (equivalent to 0.02 percent of GNI, which is just above the CDI median of 0.019 percent). It ranks 24th on the female peacekeepers indicator, with women accounting for 8 percent of the UK’s peacekeeping forces, compared to the CDI average of nearly 13 percent.</p><p>The UK ranks 19th for the value and conflict potential of its arms exports: its exports are equivalent to 0.18 percent of GNI, in line with the CDI median, and the proportion of these that are sold to countries which are poor, militaristic, or undemocratic is also close to the CDI average.</p>",
      "technology": "<p>The UK ranks 12th in the technology component, a rise of five places since the previous CDI, reflecting an increase in the foreign students it hosts.</p><p>On the UK’s policies to encourage technology creation, the UK ranks in the top 10 countries on its tax incentives to private researchers, equivalent to 0.34 percent of GNI (compared to a CDI average of 0.19 percent). However, the UK government could spend more directly on research and development, as here the UK ranks 21st and its allocation has fallen below the CDI average (0.51 versus 0.55 percent of GNI, respectively).</p><p>In terms of policies to diffuse and share technology, the UK ranks 6th for the number of foreign students it welcomes (when weighted by the income level of their origin countries), and over half of these are female (51 percent compared to a CDI average of 49 percent). Nevertheless, it ranks outside the top 10 on including researchers from lower-income countries in its international research teams. And its free trade agreements are assessed as being among the most restrictive of any CDI country relative to World Trade Organization standards.</p>"

Its bilateral provision is transparent and largely untied. However, Greece’s bilateral development finance also does poorly on targeting recipients with the greatest needs, scoring poorly on poverty focus (38th) and fragility focus (29th: this is the area of this component where Greece could most improve.</p>",
      "investment": "<p>Greece ranks 16th in the investment component. It has strong financial transparency standards, ranking joint top or near the top of the table on most of the financial secrecy measures. However, it ranks relatively low (joint 24th) on business and human rights: it has not yet launched its national action plan on business and human rights, and it has not participated in the peer review process on the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises. Furthermore, it performs worse than average (30th) on investment agreements, suggesting it should do more to limit clauses in agreements with developing countries that protect its investors at the expense of the development policy space of the countries that host them.</p>",
      "migration": "<p>Greece ranks 21st on the migration component, a drop of 19 places since the last CDI. In the previous period, Greece had a very high level of inward migration from lower-income countries, particularly Afghanistan, but its migration level has now fallen below average, and inflows have tended to be from wealthier countries than its CDI peers. It now ranks 26th on our non-refugee migration indicator, from 2nd last year; it is also in the bottom 10 countries for the share of migrants that are female (37 percent). Greece, however, remains in the top 10 of countries for refugee hosting, with nearly 21 refugees per 1,000 people.</p><p>Greece ranks among the bottom half of CDI countries for its migrant integration policies, with particularly weak policies to ensure migrants have access to political participation, education, and citizenship. It should also sign and ratify the International Labour Organization’s conventions on Migrant Workers and Migration for Employment.</p>",
      "trade": "<p>Greece ranks 26th in the trade component. As an EU member state, it performs well on tariffs, ranking joint 4th on tariff averages and joint 7th on the number of tariff peaks (tariff lines with rates of 15 percent or more), weighted inversely by trading partner income. However, Greece ranks in the bottom half of the table on the quality of its customs and trade infrastructure (23rd) and on the number of trade restrictions on services (26th). On agricultural subsidies, it ranks 35th, as its farmers receive 26.0 percent of production value in subsidies, compared to a CDI average of 12.6 percent. Greece should be open to EU-level reforms that reduce these subsidy levels to even the playing field with lower-income country food producers.</p>",
      "environment": "<p>Greece ranks 11th in the environment component. It ranks just outside the top 10 for its greenhouse gas emissions, with direct emissions of 7.1 tonnes of CO<sub>2</sub> equivalent per capita compared to a CDI average of 9.1, and it is one of only 12 CDI countries to have negative emissions embodied in international trade. Greece ranks joint top on environmental and biodiversity treaties—it has also ratified all the treaties assessed in the CDI and since the last edition has reported on its implementation of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora.</p><p>Greece has significant room for improvement on subsidies given to the production and consumption of fossil fuels, as its financial support for coal, oil, electricity, and gas (scaled for carbon intensity) is among the highest five countries in the CDI. Greece has also fallen into the bottom ten countries on the provision of harmful fishing subsidies—these amount to 13.5 percent of production value to its fishing industry—well-above the CDI median of 2.2 percent.</p>",
      "health": "<p>Greece ranks 36th in the health component. It ranks 10th for export restrictions on food and health products and mid-table for its participation in health codes, treaties, and memberships. Among these are the Global Antimicrobial Resistance and Use Surveillance System module on antimicrobial resistance, which Greece joined in 2018, but it could improve by also participating in the antimicrobial consumption module. Greece’s wider efforts on antimicrobial resistance are poor, and it ranks last in this area due to high rates of antibiotic consumption in both humans and livestock, and weak governance.</p><p>Greece ranks in the bottom half of the table on the indicators measuring vaccination coverage (22nd). Although the country’s coverage for the diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis vaccine is near-perfect and joint-highest in the CDI, coverage of the measles vaccine is low at 83 percent—well below the CDI median of 92 percent and the World Health Organization target of 95 percent.</p><p>In terms of pandemic preparedness, Greece performs poorly as one of 10 countries that have not fulfilled any of the four measures we assess, with no national influenza plan in the last decade and no joint external evaluation of public health risks with the WHO.</p>",
      "security": "<p>Greece ranks 14th in the security component, but after we adjust Greece's score on the security component relative to an expected score based on its income, it rises by eight ranks to 6th.</p><p>Greece ranks in the top 10 for its peacekeeping contributions: its troop contributions to UN missions are slightly lower than the CDI average, but its financial contributions to the UN as a percentage of GNI are fourth highest of all CDI countries at 0.01 percent compared to an average of 0.007 percent. The financial-equivalent value of troops deployed to non-UN missions is also higher than the CDI average. Furthermore, a relatively high proportion of Greece’s UN peacekeepers are female (16 percent compared to a CDI average of 13 percent).</p><p>Greece performs relatively well on international sea lanes protection, contributing an equivalent of 0.05 percent of GNI, the sixth highest of CDI countries. It also does better than the average CDI country on arms trade, with a low volume of arms exports and with trading partners that are less likely to be poor, militaristic, and undemocratic countries—i.e., those that are more conflict-prone.</p>",
      "technology": "<p>Greece ranks 30th in the technology component.</p><p>It ranks mid-table on government support for research and development (R&amp;D), with approximately 0.64 percent of GNI allocated directly by the government to R&amp;D, which is slightly higher than the CDI average of 0.55 percent. However, it performs less well on tax incentives, for which it ranks 23rd. Greece’s number of foreign students per capita (weighted by origin country income) was lower than the CDI average, and its research collaborations were more likely to be with researchers from other high-income countries.

It also has negative emissions embodied in its international trade. India ranks mid-table (19th) for its production of fossil fuels, but it comes in the top half for the low subsidies it provides to fossil fuel production and consumption. Still, India has limited ambition in its climate targets. According to its Nationally Determined Contribution, by 2030, India plans to reduce emissions by 25 percent relative to a business-as-usual scenario (which incorporates continued strong economic growth). It has significant room for improvement on carbon pricing, where it ranks joint last for taking no measures to increase the cost of emitting carbon.</p><p>India should increase its participation in international biodiversity and environmental agreements, where it comes in joint 17th. It has not yet accepted the World Trade Organization Agreement on Fisheries Subsidies, and it should improve its reporting under the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora.

It performs well on limiting trade restrictions, ranking 9th for having few services trade restrictions, and, along with other EU members, joint 4th on tariff rates and joint 7th on the number of tariff peaks (tariff lines with rates of 15 percent or more). All tariffs are weighted inversely to trading partner income. However, Ireland ranks mid-table on trade logistics and 33rd on agricultural subsidies (a policy largely decided at the EU rather than country level): its farmers receive 21.7 percent of production value in subsidies, nearly double the CDI average of 12.6 percent.</p><p>Ireland could improve trade access for lower-income countries by improving the quality of its customs procedures and trade infrastructure, and by seeking to reduce the level of agricultural subsidies in forthcoming negotiations over the EU budget.</p>",
      "environment": "<p>Ireland ranks 29th in the environment component.</p><p>Much of Ireland’s low ranking relates to its greenhouse gas emissions. Though its direct emissions from energy, industry, waste, and agriculture have fallen in recent years, at 10.7 tonnes of CO<sub>2</sub> equivalent per capita, they remain above the CDI average of 9.1. It also has relatively high emissions from land use and forestry, and those embodied in international trade. Ireland’s support to fossil fuel production and consumption is over 1 percent of GNI, and it ranks 29th on that indicator. Ireland should reduce the subsidies it provides for oil use and production especially, which are currently worth more than double the CDI average.</p><p>Ireland, like many EU countries, performs relatively well on carbon pricing, adding $25.39 to the cost of a tonne of emitted CO<sub>2</sub>, compared to a CDI average of $15.23. However, the EU’s fishing subsidy regime as applied in Ireland means its harmful fishing subsidies are worth 4.5 percent of landed fish value—far higher than the CDI median of 2.2 percent. Ireland also has room for improvement in how it engages with international biodiversity and environmental agreements; it has not submitted reports on the implementation of either the Convention on Biological Diversity or the UN Convention to Combat Desertification.</p>",
      "health": "<p>Ireland ranks 23rd in the health component.</p><p>Along with other EU member states, it performs relatively well for how few export restrictions it imposes on food and health products.

However, while its consumption of antibiotics in humans and animals is below average, its wider AMR governance is relatively weak; Ireland could complete a Joint External Evaluation with the WHO to improve on this front. This would also contribute to its pandemic preparedness, for which it is among 11 CDI countries that have not fulfilled any of the four measures we assess; for example, Ireland has not updated a national influenza plan in the last decade.</p><p>Ireland should also increase vaccine rates. Its measles coverage (at the nationally recommended age) is just 80 percent—well below the CDI median of 92 percent and the WHO target of 95 percent.</p>",

However, Ireland could also stimulate more innovation by increasing direct government funding, as it allocates approximately 0.25 percent of GNI for R&amp;D, less than half the CDI average of 0.55 percent.</p><p>Ireland should also make greater efforts to stimulate the international flow of its knowledge: along with other EU members, its free trade agreements are more restrictive than the standard World Trade Organization intellectual property right provisions.

It ranks mid-table on development finance quantity, giving 0.20 percent of its GNI in <a href=\"https://www.cgdev.org/publication/finance-international-development-update\">Finance for International Development</a>—this marks an increase from two years ago, but is still slightly less than the CDI average of 0.28 percent.</p><p>It ranks in the bottom half of the table (31st) on development finance quality. It transparently publishes development finance data, and its development projects were reported by recipients as aligning with their development priorities more than for most other CDI countries. However, its financing is somewhat tied to Korean contractors and a smaller share than average—20 percent—is channelled through multilateral organisations. Furthermore, it has a slightly lower-than-average focus on poor states.</p>",
      "investment": "<p>South Korea ranks 23rd in the investment component. It does well on bilateral investment agreements, indicating that it includes fewer clauses which protect its investors at the expense of the development policy space of their hosts in these agreements than do most other CDI countries. It also ranks joint top on the new corporate tax rate alignment indicator, with a corporate tax rate well above the globally agreed effective minimum of 15 percent.</p><p>However, South Korea ranks near the bottom of the table on natural resources because it neither implements nor supports the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative. It ranks mid-table on business and human rights as it has no National Action Plan (NAP) on business and human rights, though it does include a chapter on business and human rights in a broader NAP. Furthermore, South Korea is assessed as having little or no enforcement of the OECD Anti-Bribery Convention.</p><p>South Korea has made some improvements on limiting financial secrecy, having improved its international legal cooperation and reduced its banking secrecy. However, it could further improve by requiring its multinationals to submit annual country-by-country reports on operations to limit corruption and fully complying with the Financial Action Task Force’s beneficial ownership assessment.</p>",
      "migration": "<p>South Korea ranks 29th in the migration component. It ranks in the bottom half of the table on migrant inflow (weighted inversely by migrant origin countries' incomes), and the migrants it does accept are less likely to be women than other CDI countries (at 44 percent compared to an average of 48 percent). It performs poorly on refugee hosting, with 0.1 refugees per 1,000 people—70 times fewer than the median CDI country.</p><p>South Korea’s domestic policies to help migrants integrate into society and the economy are about average, ranking joint 18th. It has completed a voluntary review of the UN Global Compact on Migration, though it has yet to ratify the International Labour Organization’s Migration for Employment Convention or its Migrant Workers Convention.</p>",
      "trade": "<p>South Korea ranks 33rd in the trade component, its worst component. It ranks in the top half of the table on agricultural subsidies, providing 8.0 percent of farm gate production value in agricultural subsidies compared to a CDI average of 12.6 percent. It does well on trade logistics—ranking joint 9th—with the quality of its customs and trade infrastructure both better than average among CDI countries.</p><p>However, South Korea’s services trade is highly restrictive, according to the OECD. Furthermore, it ranks last on the average tariff rates it imposes (when weighted inversely by the incomes of its trading partners), and in the bottom 10 on the number of tariff peaks (tariff lines with rates of 15 percent or higher). To improve its trade-related policies, South Korea should liberalise its services trade and reduce the tariffs it imposes on its lower-income trading partners.</p>",
      "environment": "<p>South Korea ranks 26th in the environment component. It has a relatively high level of greenhouse gas emissions, ranking 29th on the indicator. Direct emissions from energy, waste, agriculture, and industry account for 13.2 tonnes of CO<sub>2</sub> equivalent per capita, compared to a CDI average of 9.1 tonnes. It does show high ambition for reducing these, with its Nationally Determined Contribution implying that it intends to reduce emissions by 38 percent below business-as-usual projections suggest it will be emitting in 2030—the 10th most ambitious target of all CDI countries. Korea also does well for its low production of fossil fuels, ranking in the top 10. However, its subsidies for oil have increased since the last CDI, and it is only just in the top half of countries on avoiding support for fossil fuels.</p><p>South Korea does less well for its carbon pricing scheme (which adds only $0.10 on average to the cost of emitting each tonne of CO<sub>2</sub>, compared to a CDI average of $15.23) and for its middling participation in biodiversity and environment agreements; Korea has accepted the World Trade Organization agreement on fishing subsidies since the last CDI but not the Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals.</p>",
      "health": "<p>South Korea ranks 20th in the health component. It does well for its high vaccination coverage, ranking joint 2nd with 96 percent coverage for the measles vaccine by the nationally recommended age and 98 percent coverage for the diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis vaccine—both higher than the CDI medians of 92 and 95 percent, respectively. It imposed very few import export restrictions on food and health products over the last two years, ranking in the top 10.</p><p>South Korea has made progress since our last edition: it signed up to the Global Antimicrobial Resistance and Use Surveillance System on antimicrobial consumption and now commits to all seven treaties we consider. Still, there remains room for improvement on antimicrobial resistance (AMR), where it ranks in the bottom half: although its governance of AMR is rated highly, its human consumption of antibiotics is slightly above average (20.2 defined daily doses per 1,000 people per year compared to a CDI average of 19.1) and its use of antibiotics in livestock is considerably more intensive than average.</p><p>South Korea should also tackle illicit trade in tobacco and sign the relevant protocol, and it could do more to prepare for pandemics with a national influenza plan and biological simulation exercise.</p>",
      "security": "<p>South Korea ranks 30th in the security component. It ranks mid-table for the amount it contributes to peacekeeping efforts—its contributions in troops and finances are worth 0.015 percent of GNI, compared to the CDI average of 0.019 percent. Of the peacekeeping troops it sends on UN missions, only 6 percent are female—less than half the 13 percent CDI average. South Korea does slightly better for its protection of sea lanes, as the vessels it contributes for this purpose are worth 0.003 percent of GNI compared to a CDI median of 0.001 percent.</p><p>South Korea ranks towards the bottom of the table on arms trade and its participation in international security conventions. Its exports of arms are worth 0.60 percent of GNI—three times the CDI median of 0.18 percent, and the recipients of these exports tend to be about as prone to conflict (poorer, more militaristic, and less democratic) as average across CDI countries. South Korea should become a signatory of both the Convention on Cluster Munitions and the Anti-Personnel Mine Ban Convention, and ratify the remaining protocols of the UN Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons.</p>",
      "technology": "<p>South Korea ranks top of the technology component by some margin. It has very strong policies on knowledge creation: it has the highest level of direct government support for research and development (R&amp;D), worth 1.2 percent of GNI, and the highest tax incentives for private R&amp;D, worth 0.56 percent of GNI. These compare to CDI averages of 0.55 and 0.19 percent of GNI, respectively.</p><p>Its policies on knowledge diffusion are slightly weaker, particularly on the number of foreign students it hosts from lower-income countries (where it ranks 27th). That said, of the students it does accept, 57 percent are female—the third-highest proportion of all CDI countries. It also does fairly well on its international research collaborations, with academics from lower-income countries represented in its publications. It ranks near the top of the table on intellectual property rights, indicating that its free trade agreements generally contain fewer intellectual property rights restrictions beyond existing World Trade Organization standards than most other CDI countries.</p>"

Although these fell since the 2023 CDI from 28.7 percent to 18.6 percent of the value of production, they remain among the 10 highest in the CDI and well-above the average of 12.6 percent.

Luxembourg ranks top for its low fossil fuel production—producing no oil, coal, or gas. Since the last CDI, it has reduced the level of subsidies it provides for fossil fuel consumption, and now ranks 9th. Luxembourg has also continued to increase its carbon price, with the average tonne of CO<sub>2</sub> now costing an additional $44.11—almost triple the current CDI average of $15.23.</p><p>Luxembourg does not provide harmful fishing subsidies and participates in most of the biodiversity and environment agreements assessed by the CDI, though it should improve reporting under the UN Convention to Combat Desertification and the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora.</p>",

It also exceeded the 0.7 percent of GNI target for official development assistance (ODA) in 2024, providing 1.02 percent of GNI as ODA.</p><p>Norway ranks 17th for the quality of its bilateral development finance, a drop of 10 ranks since the 2023 CDI. Its development finance is untied, transparently reported, and has a strong focus on poorer countries. However, recipients report that projects were slightly less aligned with their own development priorities than is average for CDI countries, and a relatively small proportion of finance—23 percent—is channelled through multilateral institutions.</p>",
      "investment": "<p>Norway ranks 1st in the investment component. It performs particularly well on investment standards for natural resources, and also does well on business and human rights standards and the degree to which its bilateral investment agreements leave partners with enough policy space to pursue their own objectives. It has been assessed by Transparency International as having “moderate” enforcement of the OECD Anti-Bribery Convention, which is better than most CDI countries, but it could improve by being more transparent about how the fines and confiscation penalties are calculated in foreign bribery cases, among other things.</p><p>Norway does fairly well on financial transparency, where it ranks 12th. In particular, Norway requires country-by-country reporting from companies operating within its territory and publishes a wide range of public statistics. However, there is still room for improvement, and Norway could make gains by implementing more stringent beneficial ownership regulations.</p>",
      "migration": "<p>Norway ranks 6th on migration.</p><p>Norway comes mid-table on non-refugee migrant inflow. It accepts a relatively high number of migrants per head, though these migrants generally come from richer countries compared with the CDI average. It has also recently increased the share of women in its inward migration, rising to 53 percent from 47 percent in the previous CDI.</p><p>Norway comes 11th on refugee hosting, with over 19 refugees per 1,000 people—nearly 50 percent more than the CDI average. Still, Norway’s relative ranking on this indicator has slipped as other CDI countries did more to host refugees from Ukraine.</p><p>Norway is also strong on its migrant integration policies and has signed International Labour Organization conventions on migrant workers, though it has yet to complete a voluntary assessment of its implementation of the Global Compact for Migration.</p>",
      "trade": "<p>Norway ranks 31st on trade, falling to last place when its score is income adjusted. This makes trade Norway’s weakest-performing component in the CDI.</p><p>Norway’s tariff rates, weighed inversely by trading partner income level, are relatively high, and it also imposes a significant number of tariff peaks (tariff lines with rates of 15 percent or more) against poorer countries. Norway’s services trade is also more restrictive than average across the CDI, ranking 27th, as assessed by the OECD Services Trade Restrictiveness Index. This is especially the case in the air transport sector.</p><p>Norway has the highest agricultural subsidies of any CDI country assessed by some margin and these have increased since the last edition: it provided 56.5 percent of farm gate production value in agricultural subsidies, up from gives 45.8 percent in CDI 2023 and more than four times the CDI average of 12.6 percent.</p>",
      "environment": "<p>Norway ranks 17th in the environment component, with relatively low greenhouse gas emissions and impressive climate target ambition towards 2030, but high fossil fuel production and moderate fossil fuel subsidies.</p><p>Norway’s direct emissions (excluding land use and forestry) fell half a tonne to 8.6 tonnes of CO<sub>2</sub> equivalent per capita, slightly below the CDI average of 9.1 tonnes. Its sequestration from land use was significantly greater than the CDI average, and this was only partially offset by emissions embodied in its trade.</p><p>Based on its Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC), Norway plans to reduce emissions by 53 percent compared to what it is projected to emit in 2030 in a business-as-usual scenario; and ranks top on this indicator.</p><p>Norway ranks last on fossil fuel production, with particularly high oil and gas production. Norway’s fossil fuel production is equivalent to over 100 tonnes of CO<sub>2</sub> equivalent per capita—more than 10 times its own emissions and higher than any other CDI country. Still, Norway’s domestic carbon pricing is relatively ambitious, imposing an average additional cost per tonne of CO<sub>2</sub> of $45.99: the third highest of all CDI countries.</p><p>Norway scores well on fishing subsidies, as it does not provide any harmful subsidies to encourage global fish stock depletion and it has recently signed up to the World Trade Organization agreement on fish subsidies. It could, however, improve its participation on biodiversity and environmental agreements by signing up to and reporting on implementation of the UN Convention to Combat Desertification.</p>",
      "health": "<p>Norway ranks 2nd on health. It ranks 6th on antimicrobial resistance (AMR): its human and livestock consumption of antibiotics are both significantly below the CDI averages, and it has approved a national action plan on AMR. It has also signed up to the Global Antimicrobial Resistance and Use Surveillance System for both antimicrobial resistance and consumption.</p><p>Norway has significantly reduced its export restrictions imposed on food and medical products in the last two years, with just eight product lines affected relative to 51 in the last CDI, moving it into the top 10 on this measure.</p><p>Norway’s vaccination coverage across the measles vaccine and the diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis vaccine is within the top 10 of all CDI countries. Norway has a middling performance on pandemic preparedness and could improve its score by completing a Joint External Evaluation with the WHO.</p><p>Norway has signed both the Framework Convention on Tobacco Control and the related Protocol against Illicit Trade.</p>",

Of its UN peacekeepers, 22 percent are female, compared to a CDI average of only 13 percent, placing Norway 8th on this measure.</p><p>Norway’s arms sales were worth 0.16 percent of its GNI, which is less than the median of all CDI countries, and the destinations of those arms exports were assessed as being less conflict-prone than the CDI average.</p><p>Norway has signed and ratified all nine international security conventions we consider.</p>",
      "technology": "<p>Norway ranks 13th in the technology component, a drop of nine ranks from the 2023 CDI. It does reasonably well in subsidising knowledge production, allocating 0.70 percent of GNI directly to research and development (R&amp;D)—more than the CDI average but still a drop from over 1 percent in the 2023 CDI. In addition, Norway encourages private R&amp;D with a further 0.15 percent of GNI through implied tax subsidies—though this, too, is a decline.</p><p>Norway ranks mid-table for its policies on knowledge diffusion to poorer countries: foreign students make up 5 percent of the total tertiary student population, and these students tend to come from richer countries compared to most CDI countries. Norway also ranks mid-table on research collaboration; its researchers co-author papers with researchers from relatively poorer countries less often than other CDI countries.</p>"

It scores well on transparency, and its development projects are mostly open to bids from companies of other nationalities, but its finance allocations should focus more on poorer and more fragile states. Also, it disburses a below-average share of its finance through multilateral organizations (12 percent compared to a CDI average of 47 percent), and there is scope for New Zealand to improve the degree to which its development projects align with recipients’ development priorities.</p>",
      "investment": "<p>New Zealand ranks 14th on investment. It ranks joint top on its corporate tax rate alignment, as its corporate tax rates exceed both the globally agreed 15 percent minimum and the developing country average of 25 percent, thereby limiting the potential for base erosion and profit shifting from other jurisdictions. It also ranks in the top three on its bilateral investment agreements, as these leave significant policy space for developing country counterparts to pursue their development objectives.</p><p>However, its commitment to investment for development is inhibited by its weak performance on the financial secrecy indicators, where it ranks in the bottom 10. It is also rated by Transparency International as having only “limited” enforcement of the OECD Anti-Bribery Convention, and though it has recently participated in peer reviews relating to the OECD multinational enterprise guidelines, it has room to improve. New Zealand should adopt a National Action Plan on business and human rights, fully enforce the OECD Anti-Bribery Convention, and take steps to reduce financial secrecy—especially as regards beneficial ownership regulations.</p>",
      "migration": "<p>New Zealand ranks 15th on migration. Its contribution to hosting refugees has fallen relative to others and is now in the bottom half of countries, with just 0.4 refugees per 1,000 people, compared to a CDI average of 11.</p><p>Still, New Zealand ranks 11th on migrant inflows (when weighted inversely by the income of their origin countries), and 49 percent of these migrants are female (above the CDI average of 48 percent). It also has strong domestic migrant integration policies, ranking within the top five on this indicator. However, it scores poorly for its participation in international migration agreements: it has not ratified the International Labour Organization’s Migrant Workers Convention, has excluded provisions in its ratification of the Migration for Employment Convention, and has not yet submitted a voluntary review under the UN Global Compact for Migration.</p>",
      "trade": "<p>New Zealand ranks 5th on trade, making this its strongest component. It ranks 1st on average tariff rates against lower-income countries and joint 1st for avoiding tariff peaks, as it has no tariff lines with rates above 15 percent. It also ranks 1st for having few agricultural subsidies (which are 0.2 percent of production value, compared to a CDI average of 12.6 percent). Since the 2021 edition of the CDI, New Zealand has also somewhat reduced the restrictiveness of its trade in services and comes 14th on this indicator. However, New Zealand’s performance on trade logistics puts it in the bottom half of countries as assessed by the World Bank—the quality of its trade infrastructure is marginally above average, but its performance on its customs regime continues to lag others.</p><p>Environment<br />New Zealand ranks 25th on the environment component. It ranks 1st on limiting harmful fishing subsidies, actually taxing harmful elements of this sector rather than subsidising activities which could encourage global stock depletion. It also performs well on limiting financial support to the domestic consumption and production of fossil fuels, ranking 5th on this indicator.</p><p>New Zealand should improve its climate-related policies by reducing both its production of fossil fuels—especially gas and coal—and its greenhouse gas emissions. Since the 2023 CDI, its direct greenhouse gas emissions from energy, waste, agriculture, and industry fell almost a tonne to 14.6 tonnes of CO<sub>2</sub> equivalent per capita, but this remains far above the CDI average of 9.1 tonnes per capita. Still, New Zealand scores well on our measure of climate target ambition, with its Nationally Determined Contribution ranked in the top 10 most ambitious of all CDI countries, aiming for emissions levels at least 40 percent below business-as-usual projections for 2030.</p><p>New Zealand received much less credit for its carbon pricing in this edition of the CDI as government revenue from emissions trading fell substantially in the latest data, suggesting the additional cost it imposes per average tonne of CO<sub>2</sub> emitted fell from over $16.17 in the previous edition to just $0.29.</p>",

It also performs well on pandemic preparedness, having completed a Joint External Evaluation with the World Health Organization (WHO), and updated its National Influenza Plan in the last decade.</p><p>New Zealand has reported reduced human consumption of antibiotics and so moved into the top half of countries avoiding antimicrobial resistance. Still, New Zealand ranks in the bottom 10 countries for its low vaccination coverage: its coverage for both the measles and the diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis vaccines remains below CDI averages. New Zealand should also improve its regulation of international tobacco supply chains by signing onto the Framework Convention for Tobacco Control, and it should improve its participation in international health agreements and memberships by signing onto the Minamata Convention and participating in the WHO’s Global Antimicrobial Resistance and Use Surveillance System.</p>",

However, women are well represented in its UN peacekeeping forces, accounting for 24 percent (almost double the CDI average). It does not provide any vessels to international sea lanes protection.</p>",
      "technology": "<p>New Zealand ranks 10th on technology. It provides relatively little support for new knowledge creation: the government spends just 0.48 percent of GNI directly on research and development (R&amp;D), below the CDI average of 0.55 percent. Still, New Zealand has increased the tax subsidies it provides to business R&amp;D, and these are now equivalent to a further 0.14 percent of its GNI—though still lower than the CDI average.</p><p>New Zealand’s high rank on the technology component is buoyed by its relatively stronger policies on technology diffusion: it ranks in the top 10 on the number of foreign students it hosts (when weighted inversely by their origin country incomes), and in the top half on including researchers from poorer countries in its international research teams. Its free trade agreements also tend to contain much fewer restrictive intellectual property rights provisions than is true for most CDI countries, further promoting technology transfers and putting New Zealand 2nd on this indicator.</p>"

Polish development finance is transparently reported, and Poland gives 72 percent of its development finance through multilaterals. However, recipients report that projects do not align with their countries’ priorities as much as the average across CDI countries, and Poland’s bilateral development finance has a much lower focus on relatively poorer and more fragile countries than most CDI countries.</p>",

Still, Poland’s enforcement of the OECD Anti-Bribery Convention has been assessed as limited to none by Transparency International. Poland also does not implement or support the Extractives Industry Transparency Initiative.</p>",
      "migration": "<p>Poland ranks 19th in the migration component. This represents a significant improvement over its rank of 34th in the 2021 CDI, with this rise largely resulting from the significant number of Ukrainian refugees it has accepted since Russia’s invasion. Poland comes 5th out of CDI countries on refugee hosting relative to its own population, with 26.7 refugees per 1,000 people in 2024, a significant increase over the 0.1 refugees per 1,000 people it hosted in 2021; many of these new refugees are from Ukraine.</p><p>However, Poland’s performance on migration is held back by its poor migrant integration and protection policies. Poland has not completed a voluntary review of the UN Global Compact for Migration, nor has it signed two of the relevant International Labour Organization conventions on migrant worker protections.</p><p>Poland also ranks 22nd on non-refugee migrant inflows from poorer countries.

This is especially true for Poland’s coal production: despite committing to a coal phase-out by 2049, progress has been slow, and although there was a drop in recent years, it remains high at almost double the CDI average. Poland’s fossil fuel subsidies were also higher than the CDI average, with the highest level of support given, again, to highly polluting coal.</p><p>Poland also ranks joint-last on its harmful fishing subsidies, which contribute to global stock depletion and overfishing.</p>",
      "health": "<p>Poland ranks 35th in the health component, its weakest performance.</p><p>Poland has significant room for improvement on its antimicrobial resistance stewardship, with antibiotic consumption higher than the CDI average both for its human population and its livestock.

It has not completed a Joint External Evaluation with the World Health Organization, updated its National Influenza Plan, or completed a Performance of Veterinary Services evaluation with the World Organisation for Animal Health in the last decade.</p><p>Poland has ratified the Framework Convention on Tobacco Control but should do more to regulate tobacco supply chains by monitoring and reporting on illicit trade under the convention.

Its bilateral free trade agreements are also ranked mid-table in not containing more restrictive intellectual property rights provisions than already exist under World Trade Organization standards.</p><p>However, Saudi Arabia could improve its policies to encourage technology creation. Its government could spend more directly on research and development (R&amp;D), as here Saudi Arabia ranks in the bottom five, with an allocation of 0.22 percent of GNI versus a CDI average of 0.55 percent.

Still, this figure represents a continued reduction in development finance volumes since 2021. Sweden surpasses the 0.7 percent of GNI UN-approved target for official development assistance (ODA), having provided 0.79 percent of GNI in 2024. The current government, which took office in late 2022, announced a move away from the previous government’s target of spending 1 percent of GNI in ODA.</p><p>The finance Sweden provides is of a high quality, ranking 2nd.

Sweden also has very efficient customs procedures and good trade infrastructure, facilitating streamlined and lower-cost trade across its borders.</p><p>However, Sweden’s openness on trade is held back by its relatively poor performance on agricultural subsidies, which rose from 11.5 to 12.6 percent of production value since the 2023 CDI while other countries’ subsidies fell (Sweden now ranks 22nd on this indicator, down from 19th). The forthcoming EU budget negotiations are an opportunity to reduce these subsidy levels.

Of this, the indirect emissions embodied in Swedish international trade are more than double the CDI average, indicating that Sweden displaces more emissions to other countries. Its fossil fuel production is also among the lowest five of CDI countries.</p><p>Sweden has a below-average performance in terms of financial support for the domestic consumption and production of fossil fuels. While it should reduce or eliminate its fossil fuel subsidies, it has instead markedly increased these over the last two editions of the CDI—more recently in response to energy price shocks resulting from Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.

We give full credit for Türkiye’s refugee hosting in the migration component but exclude any domestic spend from our development finance measure.</p><p>Türkiye ranks in the bottom half of the table on development finance quality. Much of its support goes to Syria, and so it has a relatively strong focus on poorer and more fragile countries in its bilateral finance, and it reports on this finance regularly and transparently. However, it provides a very low proportion (4 percent) of its finance to the multilateral system relative to a CDI average of 47 percent. Its performance is also held back as there is insufficient published data to assess the extent to which Turkish finance is tied to the provision of goods and services from Turkish contractors, and the degree to which recipient countries report projects as aligning with their own priorities.

Although they tended to be from lower-income countries than is the case in other CDI countries, Türkiye only ranked 25th on this indicator. The gender balance of its immigrants was one percentage point above the CDI average at 49 percent female.</p><p>Türkiye ranks in the bottom 10 countries on its migrant integration policies and has substantial room for improvement.

It could lower its tariffs on imports from lower-income countries, where it ranks in the bottom 10 in terms of the level and the number of tariff peaks over 15 percent. It could improve its customs and trade infrastructure, where it ranks in the bottom 10 countries. These costs can be regressive, impeding imports from poorer countries. Türkiye could also lower its restrictions on services trade, where it also ranks in the bottom 10 countries.</p>",

Its greenhouse gas emissions are amongst the lowest in the CDI, with direct emissions of 6.4 tonnes of CO<sub>2</sub> equivalent per capita compared to a CDI average of 9.1.

    "components": {
      "development-finance": "<p>The US ranks 25th on development finance, and after adjusting its score for its relatively high income, this falls by 14 ranks to 38th. The data used in this assessment predates the Trump administration, which, after taking office, <a href=\"https://www.cgdev.org/blog/foreign-aid-rescissions-and-ongoing-crisis-delivery\">proposed</a> steep cuts to finance volumes and cancelled many foreign assistance awards while also terminating large swathes of experienced staff, which is likely to significantly affect the quality of aid.</p><p>While the United States was the largest foreign aid donor in the world in absolute terms, based on 2024 data, the country provided just 0.18 percent of its GNI in cross-border, grant-equivalent <a href=\"https://www.cgdev.org/publication/finance-international-development-update\">Finance for International Development</a> compared to a CDI average of 0.28 percent—putting it in the bottom half of the table on development finance quantity.</p><p>The quality of that finance has deteriorated since our last assessment, down from 13th to 28th. Though US finance is very transparent and aligns well with its partner countries’ development objectives, its focus on poorer and more fragile countries has fallen. In addition, US finance is somewhat tied to bids from US contractors. Inhibiting its effectiveness. The share of finance channelled through multilateral institutions has also dropped to 14 percent from 24 percent two years ago.</p>",
      "investment": "<p>The US ranks 18th on investment, though after income adjusting its score, it falls by 13 ranks to 31st.</p><p>The US ranks joint 1st on anticorruption, with active enforcement of the OECD Anti-Bribery Convention as assessed by Transparency International. It contributes to improved governance of natural resource investment (ranking joint 4th on this indicator) by participating in the Kimberley Process and supporting the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative. Its bilateral international investment agreements leave significant policy space for developing country counterparts to pursue their own development objectives (ranking 8th). The US also performs well on business and human rights, implementing the OECD guidelines on multinational enterprises (ranking joint 8th).</p><p>However, the US ranks last on limiting financial secrecy. It is rated “non-compliant” on the Financial Action Task Force’s beneficial ownership assessment, does not require its multinational firms to produce country-by-country reports, and has no provisions for automatic exchange of information with other governments. It is also the only country assessed in the CDI not to have ratified the Council of Europe / OECD Multilateral Tax Convention. The Trump administration has also withdrawn its commitments to the OECD Pillar Two framework (which was negotiated by the Biden administration and attempts to limit base erosion and profit shifting by multinational enterprises), and although agreement for a “side-by-side system” has been reached within the G7 as of June 2025, concerns remain about potential retaliatory measures and how this will impact global confidence in the application of a global minimum tax.</p>",
      "migration": "<p>The US ranks 26th on migration, though the Trump administration has introduced significant changes to US migration policy that are not captured here and are likely to result in a deterioration in its score on this component.</p><p>The US welcomes fewer migrants from lower-income countries relative to its population than most CDI countries, ranking 30th on this indicator. It also welcomes comparatively few refugees—1.3 per 1,000 people (below the CDI mean of 11). Still, its score is improved by the gender balance of migrants it accepts, ranking in the top five on the proportion of migrants it hosts that are female (55 percent compared to a CDI average of 48 percent). Its policies for integrating migrants into its society and the economy as assessed in 2020 were relatively strong (ranked 6th).</p><p>The US ranks joint last on its participation in international migrant conventions and could improve by performing a voluntary review under the Global Compact for Migration, and ratifying the International Labour Organization Conventions on Migration for Employment and Migrant Workers to protect the rights of its migrant workers.</p>",
      "trade": "<p>The US ranks 10th on trade based on data relating mainly to 2023, and before the Trump administration adopted a new series of shifting reciprocal and sector-specific tariffs. This approach is likely to have detrimental effects on its lower-income trading partners.</p><p>The US has high quality customs and trade infrastructure, ranking joint 14th on trade logistics, and it has relatively unrestricted trade in services, ranking 16th. It performs in the top half of countries in terms of avoiding trade-distorting agricultural subsidies, providing an equivalent of 6.3 percent of farm gate production as subsidies to domestic farmers, and lower than the CDI average of 12.6 percent.</p><p>The US’s average tariff rates (when weighted inversely to trading partner income) are higher than the CDI median and it also has more tariff peaks (rates of 15 percent or more), ranking 24th and 25th, respectively. As the US implements its new trade regime, it should consider the impact on the poorest countries, and consider extending the African Growth and Opportunity Act, which expires at the end of September and provides duty-free treatment for select goods produced in qualifying sub-Saharan African countries.</p>",
      "environment": "<p>The US ranks 36th on environment, making this its weakest component.</p><p>The US performs poorly—ranking last—on its participation in international biodiversity and environmental agreements, which incorporates its latest withdrawal from the Paris climate agreement.</p><p>The US also ranks near the bottom of the table (36th) for its high greenhouse gas emissions, with 18.5 tonnes of CO₂ equivalent per capita emitted directly from its energy, industry, waste, and agriculture (excluding land use and forestry), an increase of 0.5 tonnes since the last CDI and now double the CDI average of 9.1 tonnes (all based on 2023 data). The US did have high ambitions for reducing this, ranking within the top five on climate target ambition: based on its Nationally Determined Contribution, the previous administration planned to reduce emissions by 45 percent relative to 2030 projections of business-as-usual.</p><p>The US also ranks well—within the top five—for giving low levels of support to fossil fuels. However, it performs less well on carbon pricing, with just $1.27 added to the cost of emitting an average tonne of CO<sub>2</sub> countrywide, against a CDI average of $15.23. It also ranks 33rd on fossil fuel production, producing large amounts of oil, gas, and coal relative to the size of its population.</p><p>The US could improve its environmental performance by rejoining the Paris climate accord, fully participating in and ratifying all biodiversity and environmental agreements and treaties assessed in the CDI, reducing fossil fuel production and greenhouse gas emissions, and implementing an ambitious nationwide carbon pricing scheme to incentivise a reduction in fossil fuel use.</p>",
      "health": "<p>The US ranks 32nd on health.</p><p>It ranks joint 6th on pandemic preparedness, as it has completed a Joint External Evaluation with the World Health Organization (WHO) and has developed a national influenza plan in the last decade. The US also ranks well on antimicrobial resistance (AMR) at 8th—it does well on AMR governance according to its recent WHO Joint Evaluation Exercise but should look to reduce its above-average levels of antibiotic consumption per capita (of 22.8 defined daily doses per 1,000 people vs the CDI average of 19.2).</p><p>The US ranks 38th on its participation in health treaties, codes, and memberships, and it ranks joint last on regulating international tobacco supply chains. It also does poorly on the degree to which it places export restrictions on food and health-related goods, ranking 35th, with restrictions affecting over 50 product lines over the last two years (most countries applied 12 or fewer).</p><p>The US could improve its health-related performance by signing onto the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control, the Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants and Basel Convention on Hazardous Waste, and the WHO’s Global Antimicrobial Resistance and Use Surveillance System module on antimicrobial consumption, as well as fully implementing its commitments under the International Code on Marketing of Breast Milk Substitutes.</p>",
      "security": "<p>The US ranks 17th on security.</p><p>The US ranks 1st on sea lanes protection by a significant margin, contributing an equivalent of 0.2 percent of its GNI in naval vessels protecting international waters, as compared to a CDI average of 0.019 percent, and with the next-best country, the Netherlands, providing less than half as much at 0.09 percent. It  ranks in the bottom 10  on peacekeeping contributions – whilst providing large numbers of troops to non-UN but internationally approved missions, its financial contributions to the UN Department of Peacekeeping Operations have been declining in both absolute and relative terms. Of the UN peacekeepers it deploys, only 10 percent are women, which is slightly below the CDI country average of 13 percent.</p><p>However, the US ranks 35th—joint with China—on its participation in international security treaties. It also ranks mid-table for its arms trade, with a higher-than-average volume of exports relative to its GNI (0.23 percent against a CDI median of 0.18 percent)—though these exports are sold to less poor, more democratic, and less militaristic states, which are assessed as less conflict-prone, than the CDI average.</p>",
      "technology": "<p>The US ranks 33rd in the technology component, with performance in the top half on technology creation, but lower-than-average performance on most policies for technology diffusion.</p><p>In its policies to stimulate technology production, the US ranks 12th on government support for research and development (R&amp;D) by allocating 0.65 percent of GNI directly to R&amp;D (above the CDI average of 0.55 percent), and it ranks 28th on tax incentives by providing the equivalent of 0.07 percent of its GNI as subsidies to private researchers in 2023, a decrease from 0.16 percent in 2021 and below the CDI average of 0.19 percent.</p><p>On its policies to encourage technology diffusion, the US ranks in the top 10 on research collaboration: US researchers were more likely to collaborate with researchers from lower-income countries than for most CDI countries. But it ranks mid-table on the numbers of foreign students it welcomes from poorer countries, and among the bottom of the table on the proportion of these that are female (45 percent against a CDI average of 49 percent). The intellectual property rights (IPR) provisions that the US includes in its free trade agreements are significantly more restrictive than those contained in the standard World Trade Organization provisions, and it ranks 38th for this indicator.</p><p>The US could improve on the technology component by welcoming more students, especially women, and reducing the stringency of the IPR provisions in its trade agreements to facilitate greater international flow of knowledge.</p>"

    "overall": "<p>South Africa ranks 29th on the Commitment to Development Index, and it is the best performer amongst the BRICS+ countries we assess. South Africa’s strongest component is security, where it ranks 9th, while it has the most room for improvement on the migration component—for which it ranks 34th.</p><p>When we assess South Africa’s performance relative to expectations based on its income, it jumps to 13th place. Full income-adjusted results are at the end of the country report.</p>",
    "components": {
      "development-finance": "<p>South Africa ranks 28th in the development finance component, rising to 12th after adjusting for income. It performs better on the quality of the finance it provides than the quantity.</p><p>South Africa ranks in the bottom 10 countries for the quantity of <a href=\"https://www.cgdev.org/publication/finance-international-development-update\">Finance for International Development</a> it provides, contributing just 0.02 percent of its GNI as grant-equivalent cross-border development finance (under a tenth of the CDI average of 0.28 percent) with a significant fall in multilateral commitments since the 2023 CDI.</p><p>In terms of quality indicators, South Africa comes in the bottom half of countries. It does well in ensuring that its finance targets partners who face more severe development challenges, ranking in the top five on each of the fragility and poverty focus measures. South Africa also channels the majority—62 percent—of its development finance via multilateral institutions. However, its finance was mostly tied and less transparent than average. No data was available to assess the extent to which its development finance is provided in accordance with the priorities of its partner countries.</p>",
      "investment": "<p>South Africa ranks 32nd on investment.</p><p>South Africa has signed on to the OECD Anti-Bribery Convention—one of the few non-OECD members to have done so—but its enforcement is rated as “limited” by Transparency International. South Africa should also improve its commitment to business and human rights standards by drafting a relevant national action plan. It should improve its natural resource investment standards by implementing the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative.</p><p>South Africa has improved its efforts to address financial secrecy since our last assessment. The Financial Action Task Force’s rating of South Africa’s rules regarding disclosure of the beneficial ownership of legal persons improved from “partially compliant” to “largely compliant.” That said, South Africa still has scope to improve on financial secrecy, particularly on banking secrecy, publishing of public statistics, and anti-money laundering.</p><p>South Africa’s strongest indicator is corporate tax alignment, with its lowest available corporate income tax rate set at 28 percent, which is above both the globally agreed minimum of 15 percent and the developing country average of 25 percent.</p>",
      "migration": "<p>South Africa ranks 34th in the migration component, falling 17 places since the last edition.</p><p>South Africa has dropped significantly in terms of the number of migrants from lower-income countries it receives. It was top on this indicator based on data in the 2023 CDI, but has now dropped to 31st—inward migrants still tend to be from lower-income countries, but updated UN data suggests South Africa has accepted fewer than 1 migrant per 1,000 inhabitants annually between 2020 and 2024, relative to a CDI average of 11. There is also a significant gender gap among its immigrants: only 42 percent of immigrants are female relative to a CDI average of 48.</p><p>South Africa also ranks in the bottom half of the table on refugee hosting, with 1.1 refugees per 1,000 people.</p><p>South Africa could also improve its commitment to migration for development by ratifying the International Labour Organization’s Migration for Employment Convention and Migrant Workers Convention.</p>",
      "trade": "<p>South Africa ranks 30th in the trade component. It performs well in limiting its trade-distorting agricultural subsidies to just 0.7 percent of farm gate production value, which is considerably lower than the CDI average of 12.6 percent.</p><p>However, South Africa has significant room for improvement in reducing its tariffs against lower-income countries, where it ranks in the bottom five countries we assess. It is also in the bottom half of countries on the quality of its trade logistics.</p><p>Following the OECD’s latest assessment, South Africa has reduced restrictions on trade in its services, moving out of the bottom 10 on this indicator.</p>",
      "environment": "<p>South Africa ranks 27th in the environment component, with relatively low greenhouse gas emissions, but it has significant room for improvement on other indicators in the environment component.</p><p>South Africa’s current direct greenhouse gas emissions amount to 7.7 tonnes of CO<sub>2</sub> equivalent per capita, under the average across CDI countries of 9.1. However, its embodied emissions in trade are negative, meaning that some of South Africa’s direct emissions are emitted in goods consumed within other countries, and so its net emissions are lower than most (rank 5th).</p><p>Based on its Nationally Determined Contribution, by 2030, South Africa plans to reduce emissions by 25 percent relative to projections based on its expected economic growth, placing it 33rd on the climate target ambition indicator.</p><p>South Africa ranks in the bottom 10 countries on fossil fuel production, almost entirely in coal, and is in the bottom half of countries on fossil fuel support, with relatively high subsidies given to coal and oil production. It remains to be seen whether the South Africa Just Energy Transition Partnership announced in 2021 will accelerate the transition away from coal.</p><p>South Africa also ranks in the bottom half of the table on its participation in international biodiversity and environmental agreements. It is not a member of the International Tropical Timber Organisation but since the last CDI it has accepted the World Trade Organization Agreement on Fisheries Subsidies.</p>",
      "health": "<p>South Africa ranks 27th in the health component. It scores strongly on both pandemic preparedness and its commitment to treaties but scores poorly on vaccination rates, preventing antimicrobial resistance, and regulating tobacco trade.</p><p>Since our last edition of the CDI, South Africa has received credit for signing on to report antimicrobial resistance (AMR) reporting on consumption through the Global Antimicrobial Resistance and Use Surveillance System. It also tops the indicator on health treaties and codes, having signed up to all seven we assess. Still, the newly available data suggests a very high level of human antibiotic use, and despite progress on governance of AMR, South Africa ranks in the bottom five on preventing AMR.</p><p>South Africa also ranks in the bottom five countries on tobacco supply chains, having not yet signed onto the Protocol against Illicit Trade in Tobacco Products. It has low vaccination coverage for both measles (84 percent compared to a median of 92 percent) and for diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis (79 percent compared to a median of 95 percent).</p><p>South Africa scores well for its efforts to prepare for pandemics, having completed a Joint External Evaluation with the World Health Organization (WHO), and an assessment of its veterinary services with the World Organisation for Animal Health. It should also update its National Influenza Plan and complete a more recent simulation exercise with the WHO.</p><p>South Africa has largely refrained from implementing trade restrictions on food and health products in the last two years.</p>",
      "security": "<p>South Africa ranks 9th in the security component, rising to 3rd when adjusting for its income—its best performance. It ranks joint 1st<sup> </sup>on its participation in international security conventions.</p><p>South Africa contributes 0.026 percent of its GNI to peacekeeping efforts, more than the CDI average of 0.019 percent. South Africa also performs better than the CDI average on the gender diversity of its UN peacekeepers, ranking 9th on this indicator with 19 percent of its UN peacekeepers being female.</p><p>South Africa ranked 9th for its arms trade: the value of its arms exports was below the CDI average relative to the size of its economy, and its arms sales were just below the CDI average in terms of being sold to countries at higher risk of conflict—those which are poor, militaristic, or undemocratic.</p>",
      "technology": "<p>South Africa ranks 14th in the technology component, rising to 7th after adjusting for its income.</p><p>Although its government spends relatively little on research and development—0.32 percent of its GNI as compared to the CDI average of 0.55 percent—it scores well across indicators which measure its commitment to the diffusion and transfer of technology.</p><p>South Africa performs well in ensuring that its international research collaborations include researchers from lower-income countries, ranking 2nd on this indicator. South Africa also ranks joint 4th on intellectual property rights, having fewer restrictions in its free trade agreements that go beyond existing World Trade Organization standards. South Africa welcomes a relatively low number of foreign students, though these are the most likely to come from poorer countries. It should continue to focus on improving the gender ratio: only 47 percent of foreign students are female, and while this is lower than the CDI average of 49 percent, it does represent an improvement since five years prior when the proportion was 44 percent.</p>"
