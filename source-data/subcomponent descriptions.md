# Development Finance

<p>
    Development finance is likely the first policy area that comes to mind when considering how countries help to promote development beyond their borders. It remains an important source of assistance for many developing countries. The <a href="http://www.oecd.org/dac/states-of-fragility-2016-9789264267213-en.htm">OECD </a>finds that aid has been the largest and most reliable source of finance for the least developed fragile states over the past decade. In 1969, the <a href="http://www.oecd.org/dac/stats/the07odagnitarget-ahistory.htm">Pearson Commission on International Development</a> <a href="http://www.oecd.org/dac/stats/the07odagnitarget-ahistory.htm">proposed that rich countries</a> should spend 0.7 percent of their gross national product (GNP) on foreign aid (later defined as “official development assistance,” or ODA, by the OECD’s Development Assistance Committee). This 0.7 percent target was adopted by the UN in 1970, and in 1993, gross national income (GNI) replaced GNP as the measure. More than 50 years after it was set, only a handful of countries are meeting this target.
</p>
<p>
    Quantity is not all that matters in development finance. How it is provided can have a significant impact on development results, as acknowledged by donors in a <a href="http://www.oecd.org/dac/effectiveness/thehighlevelforaonaideffectivenessahistory.htm">series of High Level Fora on Aid Effectiveness</a>. These fora contributed to establishing key principles for improving the effectiveness of development cooperation. Today, ownership, focus on results, inclusive development partnerships, and transparency and mutual accountability are standard criteria which donors and recipients use to implement development assistance interventions. These criteria were agreed upon by 160 countries, including new and emerging cooperation providers.
</p>

# Development Finance Quantity

<p>
    This measures <a href="https://www.cgdev.org/publication/finance-international-development-fid">Finance for International Development</a> (FID) as a share of a countries national income measured using gross national income (GNI). This measures government-provided, concessional, cross-border development finance on a grant equivalent basis. It differs from ODA in that it includes the grant-equivalent of all loans, and only considers cross-border finance.
</p>
<p>
    Traditionally, development finance has been measured by ODA—a concept created by the OECD’s Development Assistance Committee (DAC). However, not all countries recognise ODA as a concept, and it is not calculated for countries outside the DAC. With the introduction of new countries to the CDI that are not part of the DAC, we have developed a new measure which is more consistent between the countries we assess in that it includes only cross-border support and includes all concessional lending rather than that exceeding a certain threshold, as in ODA.
</p>
<p>
    For countries who report to it, we use the OECD Creditor Reporter System. For those that don't, we rely on official country documents and, where necessary, make assumptions to fill in gaps. This incorporates three elements of development finance (which are outlined in more detail <a href="https://www.cgdev.org/sites/default/files/cdi-2025-methodology.pdf#page=27">in the methodology</a>):
</p>
<ul style="font-size:18px;">
    <li>
        Grants and other non-reimbursable assistance
    </li>
    <li>
        Concessional loans measured as a grant equivalent
    </li>
    <li>
        Core multilateral contributions
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Full details of the new measure are contained in the <a href="https://www.cgdev.org/publication/finance-international-development-fid">FID working paper</a>. A description can be found in the <a href="https://www.cgdev.org/sites/default/files/cdi-2025-methodology.pdf#page=27">methodology document</a>.

# Development Finance Quality

<p>
    The development finance quality indicator reflects a weighted average of bilateral and multilateral quality. The bilateral share is assessed using five measures that broadly capture best practices in development cooperation. The multilateral portion is given a score across all providers set at just above the average of bilateral quality (67th percentile) reflecting a premium for coordination and scale. The measures with weights below are used to score a country’s bilateral finance.
</p>
<ul style="font-size:18px;">
    <li>
        Poverty focus (lower-income weighted shares of bilateral finance) (40 percent)
    </li>
    <li>
        Share of allocation to fragile countries (10 percent)
    </li>
    <li>
        Transparency of development finance data (20 percent)
    </li>
    <li>
        Share of untied development finance (20 percent)
    </li>
    <li>
        Recipient country ownership of objectives (10 percent)
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    The weight of the quality subcomponent is 50 percent of the development finance component.
</p>

# Financial Secrecy

<style type="text/css">p {margin-bottom: 20px !important;}
</style>
<p>
    The financial secrecy indicator is based on indicators drawn from the <a href="http://www.financialsecrecyindex.com">Financial Secrecy Index</a> (FSI), and directly from OECD and <a href="http://www.fatf-gafi.org">Financial Action Task Force (FATF)</a> peer reviews and mutual evaluations. The FSI is published biennially by the Tax Justice Network. It scores jurisdictions based on information on their laws, regulations, and cooperation with information exchange processes.
</p>
<p>
    In adapting the FSI indicators for the CDI, we considered whether each indicator relates to financial secrecy/illicit financial flows, whether the criteria are well supported by international norms or argument that it measures good practice in relation to preventing illicit financial flows, and whether the data appear to be reliable. On this basis we selected 8 out of 20 indicators (including two which are modified from the FSI).
</p>
<p>
    We group dependent jurisdictions with their parent jurisdictions (such as the Crown Dependencies and Overseas Territories with the UK). We use global scale weights to calculate weighted average scores for China, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, and the United States. These global scale weights are a measure each jurisdiction’s share of the global market for financial services provided to non-resident clients.
</p>
<p>
    The FSI indicators are rated on a scale for 0 to 1, where 0 is low secrecy and 1 is high secrecy.
</p>
<p>
    The weight of this indicator in the investment component is 25 percent.
</p>


# Business & Human Rights

<style type="text/css">p {margin-bottom: 20px !important;}</style>
<p>
    This subcomponent scores&nbsp;countries&nbsp;for their engagement with&nbsp;the&nbsp;OECD’s <a href="http://mneguidelines.oecd.org/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Responsible business conduct (RBC</a>) principles. These standards set out the expectation that businesses – regardless of&nbsp;their&nbsp;legal status, size, ownership or sector – contribute to sustainable development, while avoiding and addressing adverse&nbsp;impacts of&nbsp;their operations including throughout their supply chains and business relationships. &nbsp;
</p>
<p>
    The weight of&nbsp;this subcomponent in the&nbsp;finance component is 10%.&nbsp;
</p>

# Natural Resources

<style type="text/css">p {margin-bottom: 20px !important;}</style>
<p>
    This subcomponent&nbsp;measures&nbsp;countries’ commitments to ensuring&nbsp;that natural resource extraction and trade is governed by principles of&nbsp;transparency and is&nbsp;free&nbsp;from conflict. It&nbsp;is composed of&nbsp;two indicators: participation in the&nbsp;<a href="https://eiti.org/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Extractives Industry Transparency Initiative</a>&nbsp;(EITI) and participation the Kimberley Process Certification Scheme.&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
    EITI promotes transparency in the management of&nbsp;natural resources. If&nbsp;a country participates in EITI, its extractive companies (oil, gas, mining) are required to publish what they pay to the governments of&nbsp;countries they operate in, and governments that sign up to EITI are obliged to disclose what they receive&nbsp;from such companies. A multi stakeholder group monitors the process in each participating country.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
    &nbsp;
</p>
<p>
    The <a href="http://www.kimberleyprocess.com/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Kimberley Process Certification Scheme </a>is a joint initiative of&nbsp;governments, industry, and civil society that aims to eliminate the trade of&nbsp;conflict diamonds. Conflict diamonds are those whose sales contribute to&nbsp;funding armed conflicts.&nbsp;

# Anti-corruption

<style type="text/css">p {margin-bottom: 20px !important;}</style>

</p>

# Investment Agreements

<style type="text/css">p {margin-bottom: 20px !important;}</style>
<p>
    This indicator measures the degree to which clauses in international investment agreements (IIAs) limit the policy space of signatory countries, and scores CDI countries negatively the more their bilateral IIAs contain these limitations. Data on IIAs was analysed by <a href="https://politicalwatch.es/about-us/">Political Watch</a> (formerly CIECODE). The bilateral IIAs analysed are those between CDI countries and developing country counterparts (according to the <a href="https://www.oecd.org/en/topics/sub-issues/oda-eligibility-and-conditions/dac-list-of-oda-recipients.html">OECD’s list of ODA recipient countries</a>). The analysis includes the latest three IIAs which came into force in each of four time periods (pre-2004, 2004–2007, 2008–2013, 2014–present).
</p>
<p>
    When analysing regional agreements, the score is extended to all the parties involved as though it were an international investment agreement. For assessing the “sustainable quality” of the IIA, the preamble, the Fair and Equitable Treatment clause, and the investor-state dispute settlement system were analysed. Any other general clause in the treaty that extends its application to these three clauses was also analysed. Each of the three dispositions analysed was given a score ranging from 0 to 2 depending on how much their content contributes to the capacity of the agreement to promote sustainable development and foreign investments. The analysis also assessed whether the IIA protects the state’s right to regulate for pursuing legitimate sustainable development objectives.

# Corporate Tax Rate Alignment

<p>
    This indicator measures the Lowest Available Corporate Income Tax rate (LACIT), produced by the Tax Justice Network as part of the Corporate Tax Haven Index. As they <a href="https://cthi.taxjustice.net/en/how-index-works/haven-indicators">point out</a>, “a jurisdiction has a “headline” or statutory rate of corporate income tax, but in reality a multinational may end up paying a much lower effective tax rate either because of a secret tax ruling or due to specific exceptions and exemptions.” The full methodology is available <a href="https://cthi.taxjustice.net/about">here</a>.
</p>
<p>
    In cases where a country has not been assessed in the Corporate Tax Haven Index, we instead use the statutory rate from the <a href="https://data-explorer.oecd.org/vis?tm=corporate%20tax%20rates&amp;pg=0&amp;hc%5bTopic%5d=&amp;snb=36&amp;df%5bds%5d=dsDisseminateFinalDMZ&amp;df%5bid%5d=DSD_TAX_CIT%40DF_CIT&amp;df%5bag%5d=OECD.CTP.TPS&amp;df%5bvs%5d=1.0&amp;dq=.A..ST..S13%2BS1311%2BS13M..&amp;lom=LASTNPERIODS&amp;lo=1&amp;to%5bTIME_PERIOD%5d=false&amp;vw=tb">OECD</a>. The 14 CDI countries not assessed have low potential of being “major misalignment jurisdictions” and their LACIT rates are unlikely to differ significantly from their statutory rates.
</p>
<p>
    We group dependent jurisdictions with their parent jurisdictions (such as the Crown Dependencies and Overseas Territories with the UK). We use global scale weights to calculate weighted average scores for China, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, and the United States. These global scale weights are a measure of how much of the financial activity conducted by multinational enterprises is hosted by each jurisdiction, based on foreign direct investment volumes.
</p>
<p>
    We cap the rate at the average corporate income tax rate of developing countries to (a) reflect that it is differentials in rates that drive profit shifting, and (b) avoid over-rewarding countries with very high rates. The average developing country statutory corporate income tax rate, calculated using data from the <a href="https://taxfoundation.org/data/all/global/corporate-tax-rates-by-country-2022/">Tax Foundation</a>, is 25%.

# Migrant Inflow

<style type="text/css">p {margin-bottom: 20px !important;}</style>
<p>
    This indicator measures the inflow of migrants to CDI countries and is weighted by the income of the migrants’ countries of origin, i.e., migrants’ host countries are rewarded more for accepting migrants from poorer countries rather than relatively rich countries (measured by GNI/capita). Data on migrants come from <a href="http://stats.oecd.org/Index.aspx?DatasetCode=MIG">the OECD International migration database</a> where there is no data on a country in the OECD dataset, we instead use data from <a href="https://www.un.org/development/desa/pd/content/international-migrant-stock">the UN</a>. These UN data pertain to migrant stocks, however, where the OECD data records annual flows, so the difference between two years of migrant stocks from each origin country is calculated. Data on population come from the World Bank’s <a href="http://data.worldbank.org/data-catalog/world-development-indicators">World Development Indicators</a>.
</p>
<p>
    The weight of this indicator in the migration component is 30 percent.

# Refugee Hosting

<style type="text/css">p {margin-bottom: 20px !important;}</style>
<p>
    This indicator measures the degree to which the CDI country welcomes refugees. Countries are scored on the number of refugees and people in refugee-like situations hosted, as a share of the country's population.
</p>
<p>
    In the historic <a href="https://www.ohchr.org/en/migration/new-york-declaration-refugees-and-migrants">2016 New York Declaration on Refugees and Migrants</a>, all UN member states agreed that international responsibilities to shelter refugees must be “borne more equitably and predictably” across countries. Countries which host refugees are therefore given due credit in the CDI.
</p>
<p>
    Refugee data is for 2022 and comes from the <a href="https://www.unhcr.org/refugee-statistics/">UNHCR</a>, while population data come from <a href="https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SP.POP.TOTL">the World Bank</a><u>.</u>

# International Migration Conventions

<style type="text/css">p {margin-bottom: 20px !important;}</style>

# Integration Policies

<style type="text/css">p {margin-bottom: 20px !important;}</style>
<p>
    This indicator uses the data from the 2020 edition of <a href="http://www.mipex.eu/">Migrant Integration Policy Index</a> (MIPEX), which assesses how effective host country policies are helping to integrate migrants. MIPEX consists of eight categories, which together assess 167 policy indicators. MIPEX is the only comprehensive assessment tool for the integration of migrants in rich countries. The eight dimensions of MIPEX are the following:
</p>
<ol>
    <li>
        Labour market mobility
    </li>
    <li>
        Education

# Greenhouse Gas Emissions

<p>
    This indicator assesses the level of greenhouse gas emissions relative to the size of each country’s population.

# NDC Ambition

<p>
    This indicator assesses the degree to which a country’s Nationally Determined Contribution, as submitted to the UNFCCC, represents increased ambition to reduce its emissions by 2030 over expected emissions based on GDP growth projections from the <a href="https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/SPROLLS/world-economic-outlook-databases#sort=%40imfdate%20descending">IMF’s World Economic Outlook</a>. We calculate the planned emissions reduction as the expected emissions in 2030 under a business-as-usual scenario minus the NDC emissions target in 2030, and present this as a percentage of the expected emissions in 2030.
</p>
<p>
    This indicator relies on data assembled and analysed by the <a href="https://climateactiontracker.org/">Climate Action Tracker</a> (CAT). CAT makes adjustments to exclude Land Use, Land Use Change, and Forestry (LULUCF) in their analysis of countries’ NDC targets in 2030. In some cases, countries present their NDC targets as a range between a minimum and maximum, in which case we take the mid-point between these two figures to represent their NDC target. Further details about CAT’s methodology and assumptions are available <a href="https://climateactiontracker.org/methodology/">here</a>.
</p>

# Fossil Fuel Production

<p>
    This indicator captures the idea that responsibility for greenhouse gas emissions lies not only with consumers, but also with the producers who choose to supply fossil fuels on global markets. It comprises three measures: coal production, oil production, and natural gas production, with each volume of production being scaled by its relative CO<sub>2</sub> intensity.
</p>
<p>
    The weight of this indicator is 10 percent of the environment component.
</p>
<style type="text/css">
</style><style type="text/css">p {margin-bottom: 20px !important;}
</style>


# Fossil Fuel Support

<p>
    This indicator assesses the level of government support to the domestic consumption and production of fossil fuels through both taxes and subsidies. This indicator is composed of four measures: support to oil, support to gas, support to coal, and support to electricity. The value of subsidies is scaled by the carbon intensity of the fuel relative to oil; i.e. subsidies to coal production are ‘worth’ more than subsidies to gas production because coal is a ‘dirtier’ fuel. These scores are combined and standardized negatively, meaning that more support for fossil fuel production results in a lower score.
</p>
<p>
    Fossil fuel subsidies has a weight of 10 percent of the environment component.

# Carbon Pricing

<p>
    Putting an additional price on carbon is widely believed to be one of the <a href="https://www.carbonpricingleadership.org/report-of-the-highlevel-commission-on-carbon-prices/">most effective economic and policy tools</a> for meeting the Paris targets, as it can achieve emissions reductions at a low cost compared to alternative policies. The two main carbon pricing instruments, emission trading schemes (ETS) and direct carbon taxes, serve to lower demand. A carbon tax directly puts an additional cost to emitting GHGs by setting a fixed price on each unit of covered emissions. An ETS (also called a cap-and-trade system) determines the total amount of allowed emissions at a subnational, national, or regional level, which firms can then trade.
</p>
<p>
    Revenues raised by carbon pricing are a direct measure of the increased costs of emissions. These additional costs on emissions are controlled by participating jurisdictions by increasing the carbon tax rate, increasing the scope of emissions covered by carbon pricing, or by further reducing available allowances in an ETS.
</p>
<p>
    A country’s score on this measure is measured as this extra cost imposed per unit of all domestic emissions (the total value of carbon pricing as a proportion of a country’s total carbon emissions). We obtain data on the dollar value of all carbon pricing schemes from the <a href="https://carbonpricingdashboard.worldbank.org/">World Bank’s carbon pricing dashboard</a>. Data on overall direct domestic emissions is the same as that used in the “Emissions (excluding LULUF)” measure.
</p>
<p>
    Additionally, as the EU ETS is a regional scheme covering EU member states as well as some EEA states, the value must be distributed among participating countries. We take an extra calculation step and distribute the total EU ETS figure to each participating country according to <a href="https://www.eea.europa.eu/data-and-maps/dashboards/emissions-trading-viewer-1">data from the European Environment Agency (EEA)</a> on how allowances were allocated to EU member states. The proportion of the total value of the EU ETS is then allocated based on the share of the country’s allocations.
</p>
<p>

# Fishing Subsidies

<p>
    Fishing subsidies are a direct cause of overfishing, which leads to <a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/113/1/134.full">depleting transboundary fishing stocks</a> and has a <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10818-010-9090-9">negative impact on the livelihoods of communities</a> dependent on these resources. This indicator measures the value of subsidies given to a country’s fishing industry as a proportion of the value of the fish it produces (landed fish). The raw score for this indicator is expressed as a percentage subsidy rate. This is obtained by adding together potentially distortionary subsidies listed under the OECD’s <a href="https://www.oecd.org/en/topics/sub-issues/fisheries-subsidies.html">Fisheries Support Estimate database</a>, and then subtracting payments made by the fisheries sector, and is expressed as a proportion of the dollar value of total fisheries output (national landings in domestic ports plus national landings in foreign ports). This measure is standardised negatively, meaning that more subsidies result in a lower score. A list of the subsidies and payments can be found in the methodology document.

# International Environmental Conventions

<p>
    While countries can and do implement policies that benefit the environment, it still faces many of the challenges typical for global public goods. The benefits are shared by all in the longer term, while the costs of sustaining it are borne by individual countries in the shorter term. There is thus a need for coordination through multilateral commitments.

# Peacekeeping Contributions

<p>
    This indicator measures three aspects of peacekeeping contributions and is thus made up of three measures: financial contributions to the UN Department of Peacekeeping Operations budget, troops contributed to UN operations (which includes both the direct costs and the indirect costs incurred from personnel contributions), and troops contributed to non-UN (but internationally approved) operations (both indirect and direct costs). All these contributions are calculated as a percentage of a country’s GNI. Data on GNI (in national currency units) come from the World Bank’s <a href="https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GNP.MKTP.CN">World Development Indicators</a>.
</p>
<p>
    This indicator’s weight is 25% of the security component.

# Female Peacekeepers

<style type="text/css">p {margin-bottom: 20px !important;}</style>
<p>
    This indicator measures the percentage of UN peacekeepers a country contributes to peacekeeping missions that are female. Higher female participation in peacekeeping missions <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0095327X08327818">has been shown</a> to increase reporting of sexual and gender-based violence, as well as leading to lower incidents of sexual exploitation and abuse. Female peacekeepers are crucial in making the peacekeeping force approachable to women in various communities, mentoring female cadets at police and military academies, or in interacting with women in societies where women are prohibited from speaking to men. Despite this, the percentage of deployed military women currently hovers at 4 percent, and has not increased significantly since the end of 2009; as for police women, the percentage has stayed at around <a href="https://www.dcaf.ch/un-wants-deploy-more-women-peacekeeping-so-why-are-there-so-few">10 percent since 2011</a>. Data come from <a href="https://peacekeeping.un.org/en/troop-and-police-contributors">UN Department of Peacekeeping Operations</a>.

# Sea Lanes Protection

<style type="text/css">p {margin-bottom: 20px !important;}</style>
<p>
    This subcomponent assesses countries’ contribution to the protection of sea lanes based on the quantity of major ships in the navy, the naval budget and ships devoted to sea lanes protection.&nbsp;Ungoverned maritime spaces along major sea lanes are a major threat, providing refuge for armed maritime groups and a haven for illicit activities.
</p>
<p>
    Sea lanes protection&nbsp;has&nbsp;a&nbsp;weight&nbsp;of&nbsp;10% of the security component.

# Arms Trade

<p>
    Countries can affect peace and security beyond their borders if they supply arms to other countries. Arms exports may be more likely to fuel conflicts when sent to countries which do not respect citizens‘ freedom of expression (some <a href="https://www.rand.org/pubs/research_reports/RR1063.html">research</a> shows that non-consolidated democracies may be more prone to both intra- and inter-state conflicts); or if the importing country is <a href="https://www.sipri.org/sites/default/files/The_developmental_impact_of_military_budgeting_and_procurement_2008.pdf">already spending a large amount of its GDP</a> on arms (potentially implying a militaristic policy stance as well as a diversion of funds away from other basic services); or if the country is poor (the <a href="https://www.rand.org/pubs/research_reports/RR1063.html">aforementioned research</a> also shows that slow economic growth can be a driver, particularly of intra-state conflict).
</p>
<p>
    The arms trade indicator comprises two measures. The first, arms trade volume, measures the annual dollar amount of arms exports as a percentage of each CDI country’s GNI in the last five years. The second measure measures the relative likelihood that arms exports from a CDI country will incite or fuel conflicts worldwide. This is done based on the relative weighing of importing countries based on their income, military expenditure, and governance. These measures are multiplied to give the raw score for the indicator.

    This indicator’s weight is 30% of the security component.

# International Security Conventions

<style type="text/css">p {margin-bottom: 20px !important;}</style>
<p>
    Security conventions establish important global standards and set the basis for international cooperation. When countries ratify international conventions, they become part of domestic law, and countries become legally accountable for upholding these standards, thereby encouraging even more global adherence to these shared norms.
